			<h1>The Real Truth</h1>
			<h2>What Happened to the Missing Malaysian Airliner?</h2>

			<p><img src="images/ufosucksupplane.gif" width="720" height="452" alt="UFO Kidnaps the Missing Airplane" class="resize"></p>
			<p>A Malaysian military aircraft did track an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the country's airspace at the time of MH370 losing contact with the ground control, the Malaysian Prime Minister has finally admitted â€“ six weeks after the passenger jet disappeared.</p>

<p>Najib Razak said the radar tracked the UFO  after it had turned back on its from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.</p>


<p>The Malaysian Prime Minister said he initially didn't believe a UFO had been discovered in the Malyasian airspace but was told that the military radar report was quite compelling.</p>

<p>"To be honest, I found it hard to believe at first," the Prime Minister told CNN.</p>

<p>"It's a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated so that's why when I met the team...of foremost experts in aviation industry I asked them again and again 'are you sure?'"</p>

<p>"However, at least now we have the real answer. Aliens abducted the citizens in the missing Malaysian plane. Now I better contact 'UFO Busters.' They're great at dealing with pesky aliens."

			<h3>Did you know?</h3>
			<p>The name 'Area 51' derives from its marking on 1950's Nevada Test Site maps. Today, the official name of Area 51 is Air Force Flight Test Center, Detachment 3, or AFFTC Det. 3 for short. For years even our own government denied its existence until Soviet pictures confirmed what many knew all along. The base did exist. The facility was originally designed for the testing of U-2 spy planes, and ultimately Stealth technology would be born there. The secret site has grown to many times its original size. The USAF took over command of Area 51, and its airspace in 1970.</p>
